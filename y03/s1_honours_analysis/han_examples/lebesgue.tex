\subsection{Characteristic and step functions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Let $\phi$ and $\psi$ be step functions. Show that the following are also step functions:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\alpha\phi+\beta\psi$
        \item $\max\{\phi,\psi\}$ and $\min\{\phi,\psi\}$
        \item $\phi\psi$. \\
    \end{itemize}

    Firstly define step function $\phi$ wrt finite set $\{x_0,x_1\dots,x_n\}$
    and step function $\psi$ wrt finite set $\{y_0,y_1\dots,y_n\}$.
    Their linear combination is a step function wrt the union of these two finite sets.

    The rest are proven similarly via construction.

    \item Show that $\phi$ is a step function \textbf{if and only if}:
    $$\phi(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_j\chi_{J_j}(x)$$
    where $c_j$ is some constant and $J_j$ some interval. \\

    From the definition of $\phi$ we can write:
    $$\phi(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_j\chi_{(x_{j-1},x_j)}(x)
    +\sum_{j=0}^{n}\phi(x_j)\chi_{\{x_j\}}$$
    and the opposite direction is shown by the first example
    and the fact that a characteristic function is a step function.
\end{enumerate}
